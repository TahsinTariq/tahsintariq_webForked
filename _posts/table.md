title: A Table Half-Empty
---

When I sit without company
On a cracked wooden seat
Within the confound of a dazed restaurant
Will you glance in sympathy?
Will you smile apologetically?
Your eyes deflating like tired skin
A sight half empty-
A sight half perfect
Does this not mean that it is me half empty?
Half complete, half real 
Am I not in your company?
Am I not with others?
For I eat and drink from where you eat and drink
Will you think me unable to comprehend emotion?
Or happiness or light or bliss?
Without some pair of distressed, idle arms
Clasped around me
Living in a mist of ignorance of human company
I see hooks, I see chains that drag us together
which the puppeteer uses 
The rusty hooks, that when pulled reveal a wrinkle
A tired smile
That echoes around the cheek 
and settles so uncomfortably
so next time you glance at me
with your sorry smile
I will smile back and say
‘this time I am simply free’
