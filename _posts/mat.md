title: The Checkered Mat
---

Before breaths fell, heavy and still
You and I sat, starry eyed
Though we had never known a star
Or night or darkness
We sat in an endless field
Light was soft and gazed with sympathy 
On a checkered mat
And we sang like birds
As children do
And never stopped to think
Where we were 
Or if this field would sink within us

Wasps hovered like empty thoughts
And scratched our skin
And like us, hovered aimlessly 
through the haze of green and blue and angelic white
that we saw through slow and careless eyes
the wasp reached through our soft, pale skin
like the cut of a thread 
to leave a dress, just a pile of cloth and rags
and the sharp light woke us 
while we drown on the air
we were unaware that we were breathing
we fell through minds uncheckered
the light biting through our comfortable haze
and maybe that haze was easier to see
 than the harsh light that blinds me now
