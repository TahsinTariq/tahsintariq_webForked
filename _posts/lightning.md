title: The Person inside the Lightning
---

Await the next shock
Reigning over endless vicious skies
Waking the unknown for seconds
As it drifts silently and falls
In a gracious thud
To a broken, worn ground
Like a person the lightening drifts across the sky in pieces
Thinking that darkness
Is easier to conquer with its fleeting light
Similarly to a person too
It believes in assured thought
That it will split clouds into lasting stars
And it will be a moon, almost too bright to say it was
As people will think
And so it spends its light in gushes
That fall like pebbles to a forgiving earth
And it spends everything until it is an unoccupied fantasy
That rattles around clouds
And like a person it rattles 
Until it realises it was already on earth
