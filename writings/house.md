There is a house that perches on the brink of where our earthly world ends and nothing, in its utterly empty nothingness, begins. It is occupied by a fragment of a person, at least half the size of the average man. One you might see walking down the street, getting a haircut or doing any number of regular, unextraordinary activities. The man in this story, however, is anything but unextraordinary. That is, if he is a man at all. What he is, in fact, is an enigma. If one is to be completely truthful, this man is beyond enigma. You see, an enigma is a question that one must go to great lengths to find an answer to. He who lives in the house on the edge of the earth is a great many questions, the answers to all of which would be impossibly dangerous to uncover. You see, there is not one person, dead or alive, who has seen past his silhouette. No-one, not one person in the world, has a single drop of knowledge of him save that his back is hunched, and his steps slow. This is known because some people say (perhaps they are only rumours) that when he schlumps outside to take a breath of fresh air on his balcony, which extends out into the nothingness further than any person has travelled, his shape is just about visible against the black backdrop that the abyss provides. Even on the rare occasions when he does so, the house will begin to lose its balance and tilt into the bleak blankness. Forcing the crooked man to return to the interior which is indigenous to himself alone. The reason for this man being so ruinously secluded is due to the fact that the only entrance to the house, a single rickety door, dangles over the deep and dark abyss, that is his front garden. This meant that nobody, be it mountaineer, firefighter, mathematician, or architect, could possibly wrangle their way to the door. And indeed the sunken man who resides there cannot leave his precarious place of residence. 

The people of the far-away, but nearest village know him in the same way that someone may know the character of a story better than its author. The children of the village made up tales and myths about the mysterious man. They named his house “The Rocking Chair” because it swung from side to side without ever toppling either way. They had even integrated some well-known stories to include the man, who bemused them beyond words. 

“On the rocking chairs edge
Humpty dumpty sat
After losing his balance 
Re-arranging a hat
He fell where no-one comes back.”

Or

“Poor old little man
A snail stuck in a shell
God came down to earth
And asked why he’d not fell
He said “I’m sorry sir,
I’d rather not tell”
So God picked him up
And chucked him down to hell”

These were some of the gloomier rhymes that were sung in the village. The problem was that many people in the village, especially adults, detested him. Although they knew nothing of him, or his origin, they hated him because there was no documentation that claimed he had legal ownership of the house in which he had no choice but to live in. Even if he had a deed to the rickety abode he inhabited, there was no chance that he would be able to show it to the townspeople. Estate agents and rich landlords alike wanted to the house because it would be cheap to buy and gain revenue in historical value. Eviction notices were stapled to the walls of the house and many littered the ground like autumn leaves. From time to time, a lawyer or council worker would drop by the house to shout property rights at the walls in the hope that their yells would seep through the cracks and the occupant would overhear.

He never replied.
 
Deep down they knew that they would never know, or understand, the man who lived on the border of somewhere and no-where, sometimes in one state and then stateless. Between those four walls, the miniature man wrote stories to keep himself occupied. Stories for nothing, that no-one would ever hear. The words that follow are forgotten sentiments, truths lost in an unpredictable world.

The Girl Who Lost Her Own Reflection

Vanessa was the loveliest thing that ever lived except she never really knew what love was. She knew exactly what it looked like and how to imitate it convincingly but couldn’t comprehend its inner workings. Just as someone with an abundance of apples, an orchard owner for example, may eat the surface of the apple but stop before they have reached the core. If someone is scarce of apples and only has one, they will eat it, every last sliver and morsel, to the core, and there they will find the seeds to grow more. Just like this Vanessa had grown so accustomed to the waxy red shell of love: gifts, attention and adoration, that she was oblivious to the sweetness inside herself. In short, Vanessa had grown so used to looking at looks that she could no longer feel feelings.

Eventually she had become so tired of the superficialities of the kindness that handsome young men showed her, that she believed she would never find a dearer accomplice than her very own mirror. She would spend hour after hour, day after day tilting her head, admiring every possible angle of her gorgeous face. However, Vanessa was flawed. She did not know it because she believed that flaws came from outside, on the body, and not from inside, in the mind. This on its own was one of her flaws. Another was her almost offensive laziness. An uninformed onlooker might mistake her room for a small landfill, where dwelt the most beautiful rat. Vanessa could not see that her room was her burden to clean. She believed that if she tidied just a little, she might crease her face’s smooth skin by pulling an unpleasant expression. Therefore, she blamed the infestation that was her room on its natural ugliness. “It is an old, ugly room. Maybe if it had taken more care of itself when it was younger, it wouldn’t have become such a pig-sty.” Vanessa would say, the picture of her eyes in the mirror never leaving her sight. 

It was because of her laziness that she abandoned to clean her mirror, which over time grew old and distressed. It covered her face with blemishes that she denied could be her own. It must have been the work of a badly-behaved mirror, one that reflected dishonestly. Vanessa even began to envy her reflection, that it could see her perfect face and yet she was left to oogle an imposter.

This infuriated Vanessa. She could not wake up every morning with a stranger looking back at her from her very own mirror. So, in a fit of extreme annoyance, she picked up her precious, most dear mirror and hurled it onto the marble floor of her room, smashing it into pieces, some as fine as beach sand.

It is important to say that in this moment Vanessa experienced an emotion she had never felt before, regret. Regret is the short word for wishing you had a time-machine to correct an action or something you’ve said in order to alter the course of fate. Unfortunately Vanessa lived at a time before the time-machine was invented and fate-adjustment, as they call it, was not an option for her. Her fate is as permanent as the ink in which this book is printed. It can be scribbled over or smudged or hidden, but it can never be truly erased. And from this small action, done in a wink of the world's eye, Vanessa’s life was permanently altered. In fact, after this point, her life would be a series of consequential things following that single act.

After this new feeling of regret, Vanessa fell to her knees and frantically tried to connect the shards that were still intact back together, in doing so she cut her hand and jumped at the sight of the red blood revealed from inside that she had never seen before. To her surprise, upon picking up a pizza sliced slice of mirror, she could not see her reflection. Instead the shard shone with the mould that decorated the wall behind her. She screamed and screamed and begged for her reflection to return but it was too late. The mirror was tired of being harassmened. She ran her hands across her eyes, nose and chin, but no relief could be found. She began to think that she had turned entirely invisible and would never be seen by another eye again. And though she was vain, she did not deserve such a punishment, indeed no-one does. 

And so she ventured into the world, fearing the worst and looking, in appearance, beyond bewildered. Yet she was comforted by the look of shock in every passer-by’s eyes. “At least,” she thought, “they know I’m here”. So she came to the natural conclusion that her reflection had done a runner back to where reflections come from, maybe it had found refuge in a small pond somewhere. Or perhaps it scarpered to a river where it would naturally arrive at the sea, widely known as a haven for mistreated reflections. She rushed up to every stranger and begged them profusely to tell her if they had seen her reflection, and if so, which way it had run off. Each person would cry, “No! Get away!”, or “You’re mad!” As they’d never heard of such a thing. She ran downtown to the doctors who she thought could fix her eyesight or perhaps provide a vitamin to treat her transparency. 

Unfortunately, when she saw the doctor, they jumped to other conclusions and tall men, who were dressed in white despite being far from angelic, came and took her away. They threw her into Cold Creek Asylum where she was told to live out the rest of her days. 

Cold Creek Asylum is a place as kind as it’s name, though it could be called a number of things that would be better suited to it’s strange smells and unforgiving architecture. It’s walls, it seemed, were planned out of resentment and built by unhappy hands. Those who breathed between them were promised a dead life.

It had been seven days since the first day of Vanessa’s stay at Cold Creek, and each was longer than the last. She would spend most of her time in the courtyard watching lunatics and wondering what mistake she could have possibly made that would lead her to be classed as low as them. At talky-time, which was what breaktime was called in the Asylum, she would sit by herself and file her nails with an old stone. Or she would watch muddy puddles, waiting for her reflection to appear so that she could once again see her eyes sparkle as they used to, but it never did. One day she was inspecting such a puddle when a small pair of feet splashed the muddy water all over her (already) grubby pink dress. 
“Excuse me!” Vanessa huffed.
“No worries, I didn’t see you there either.”
The short man who spoke these words looked up and smiled with the friendliness, and oblivious kindness, of a golden retriever. 
“That brown shade of mud suites you much better than that pink. Anywho, my name is-”
But his voice was cut short by the bell that signified the end of talky-time. The inmates were forbidden from speaking after the bell had rung, so the full-cheeked guy had to swallow his words to prevent himself from the guard’s punishments.

Although Vanessa was surprised by how the short man had managed to preserve his sweetness during his imprisonment, she did not know the strangers secret, which was his reason for being in Cold Creek Asylum. This little scruffy man’s madness was that he was in love with the cover of a magazine.

The Man in Love with the Cover of a Magazine

Julius had loved Vanity for what felt like millennia. That was the name of the glossy blonde woman frozen in a perpetual smile on the cover of a magazine. The woman’s real name was Reese Witherspoon, however Julius had mistaken the name of the magazine, “Vanity Fair”, for hers. And so in his mind, she was “Vanity’, “Van” or “Val”, as a term of particular endearment. What he would love to remember is how she knew “how to look younger instantly”, and “the best fashion of the new season”. But most importantly, it was her smile… that smile, that kept coming back to him all those years in the cell. It was from somewhere above heaven, up in the cosmos, because every time he would look up at the night sky, the stars would align themselves into her eyebrows, teeth and lips. Which would remind him of the astrology section of the magazine- and their future together.

Although he may seem unusual, and he was too, Julius had a soft side. He would never dare be unfaithful to Vanity and had actually burst into Vanessa’s puddle deliberately, under the pretence of finding friendship in Cold Creek Asylum. Which he had called home for a year and a half, after his and Vanity’s forbidden love was discovered. The fact that Vanity, his paperback girlfriend, was stuck in an evidence locker, drove him mad. So very sadly mad that his sentence in the Asylum grew every year. And despite him being only a little older than Vanessa, his face had aged faster than the rest of him.

Julius’s problem was not stupidity, although he could be called stupid. Neither was it that he could not help but treat everyone with respect, even those who showed him no kindness in return. His weakness was one that is all too common in the world, although most people who suffer with it are not thrown into Asylums, I should say. It was that against all logic or reason, Julius was powerless to let go of love. And could not separate in his head, that love and obsession were entirely different things. 

This came from an overlap in his brain. You see, the poor little man had no comprehension of the concept of time. Asking him if tomorrow would come sooner than an hour, or a year, would have the same effect as asking any regular person when a particular waterfall will dry up. Or asking someone, for instance, when the English language will be replaced by a much superior language, like Italian. If you ask any regular person these questions, they will be confused, maybe even a little irritated. But use it as a lens to see how Julius saw the prospect of time. He saw alarm clocks as short-tempered clocks, they would screech and holler as the sun rose because they were lonely while he slept all night. On the other hand, he thought nights were dark days, and winter, a cold summer. Calendars, he thought, were indecisive posters. And tea would go cold, not because the passing of time, but because it was bored. 

And this is why he could not tell apart love and obsession. After all, obsession is not love. However if it must be compared, it can be identified as loving too much, too rigorously in too compact a space of time. And really, he cannot be blamed for his madness, as even those who are the masters of their hearts rarely love rationally.
 
When Julius was told by the prison chiefs that he could either stay in helpless adoration with his chick-flick magazine, or live in the real world, he chose Vanity. Without Vanity, he believed the world to be one huge prison cell. Now she had gone, his heart groaned. Although he preserved his kindness, his heart like a shopping centre in a hurricane, was empty, and shut forever. It seemed.

The next day, Vanessa spent talky-time staring at the same puddle. She always tried specially to notice whether it had grown or shrunk, and today it was about half empty. Julius approached her later, during movie-time. He came and sat down next to her, and without saying anything stuffed a note into her idle hand. This startled Vanessa considerably, as the notes she had received in her life had always come with a gift and were advertised by a declaration of love just beforehand. 

Julius then directed at her a look full of feelings, whose meaning she would have been able to decipher, if only it was a language she could understand. Although she did notice that this particular feeling look was not familiar, it differed from the looks that dough eyed boys would have offered her. This is because the feelings he looked at Vanessa with were not at all romantic. A feeling look is, of course, a look of any real emotion. All emotions are valid, but some, such as boredom or hesitation or itchiness, are generally known as lesser emotions. For instance, it is not unusual for someone to look at a dessert with more intense a feeling than they do their husband or wife, without wishing to marry the pudding in question.

The look that Julius gave her was one of strict companionship, not unlike a nod an army officer may give to a soldier just before embarking on a risky mission. Then swiftly, having completed his task, Julius marched away. Out of anxiety more than interest, Vanessa folded open the crumpled note. It read:

“Meat me in the fud storij too niyt
Nok won teyem”

Vanessa was appalled by the orthography as she had been a keen speller before her mirror days, but eventually deciphered the code. It was: “Meet me in the food storage tonight, knock one time”. Vanessa was puzzled to pieces, much like an unmade jigsaw, as to whether she should entertain Julius’ sloppily spelt suggestion. This strangest of offers that he had made her came more out of the blue than a beached whale, which comes of course, out of the deepest of blues.

Laying in her bed that night, Vanessa watched the star shaped cobweb in the top corner of her room, watching the dew shine whenever the moon visited from behind the clouds. All the while wondering whether she should go and meet Julius or stay and never know what could have been. 

It would not have been a hard thing pull off as Cold Creek Asylum was not a jail, although it’s doors and barred windows bared the echoes and residual whispers of a typical prison. Cold Creek could not be called a prison as the doors of the inmate’s rooms were never locked. Meaning that if anyone chose, they could freely move about the winding stairs and creaky floorboards as they wished, risking only a small punishment should they get caught. Despite this, the hallways, corridors and old cold recreation rooms of Cold Creek went uninhabited every night. Nobody dared venture from between the safety of their blankets and sheets. You see, Cold Creek’s dark corners were blacker than the night could ever aspire to be, it’s silence was more menacing than knives cutting ceramic plates, it’s stillness more startling than a kick in the knee. It’s walls sneered and the carpets shrieked. The food storage locker, the nurses who worked there had said, was the most horrifically chilling place in Cold Creek. So nobody, big or small, short or tall, left their room at night. No one at all. 

I’d forgotten to mention, however, that Vanessa had a unique intolerance to boredom which made it quite impossible for her to sit still. So despite her fellow inmates trepidation of the Asylum after dusk, she’d walk about most nights that she had stayed at Cold Creek, immune to the anxiety that would keep any regular person from doing so. Often, she went about looking for insects or ghosts to pass the time, and meanwhile enjoyed not being surrounded by hooligans or disagreeable people. The food storage room was an area of the Asylum that Vanessa had not yet discovered, and she spent some time searching without any light to lead her at all. Not even a dim candle to assist an educated guess. Though this she didn’t mind at all because she had no idea what the door to the room looked like anyway. So using her sense of smell, which was sharper in the dark, she found the unwashed pots and pans of the kitchen, and the grey goop of that day’s dinner that resided within them. Assuming the kitchen could not be far from the food storage, she shuffled about with bare feet searching for any clues as to its whereabouts. She moved from hard stone floors to wood ones, then to carpet, and felt perfectly sure she was going the wrong direction. It was at that very moment, sandwiched between that very thought, that Vanessa stepped with absolute confidence onto thin air and tumblingly flew down a flight of stairs. After prying open her eyes, Vanessa was perfectly confident that she was dead. The depth of the darkness she found herself submerged in convinced her that she had fallen all the way down into the underworld. Then she saw the brightest light stretch along the wall, and the shape of a hand drifting out to raise her up. 
“I said knock once! Ello.”
Julius grinned nobly.
“Oh,”
Said Vanessa,
“I thought I was dead!”
“I wouldn’t be surprised darlin!”
“So I’m not?”
Vanessa flustered. But before she could inquire further, Julius heaved her into the food storage room. It looked so very indulgent that it really could have been the shelves themselves who chose what treats to dress themselves in.
“That place’ll suck the life outta ya,”
Julius cracked, but Vanessa was too busy drinking in a breath so bottomless that she almost passed out.
“but you’re ready to start living again! I could tell from the moment I saw you eyeing the sky in that puddle out in ’yard.”
Then seeing the shocked look freezing over on her face,
“Cheer up!”
Vanessa was dizzy from the rollercoaster of emotions she’d sped past in that half minute and was sure she had died at least a few times. But overall, she was relieved to be alive, and was grateful for the feeling too because it was one she’d not felt for a while. And all along her body she felt as if she had been cold for a long time, and only now had she been put by the fire to thaw. All around was food- sweets, pastries and pies, and packets of biscuits hung suspended on strings from the ceiling. Vanessa wondered what they’d been feeding them in the canteen, certainly nothing she’d eaten in that past week had come from this room. 
Most days lunch would consist of a questionably coloured soup, and dinner was a blackened bit of meat with a side of watered-down mashed potato. 

Julius began on a large pile of crisps in the corner. He grabbed packet after packet, prawn cocktail, salt and vinegar, even ready salted, scoffing them down and throwing them aside without getting to the bottom of them. It had seemed like years since Vanessa had eaten well and despite that Julius’ gastro-guzzling of crisps would have disgusted her before her arrival at the Asylum, she found herself doing the exact same. 

Packet after packet went down and the pile shrunk like wool in the wash. Vanessa grabbed a bottle of milk chocolate and drank it intermittently, between crunches. She began to wonder, though she could barely hear her thoughts over the sounds of chomping and gulping, whether they would be found out and punished for stealing all this food. Julius seemed too embezzled in eating for a man afraid of a future punishment, and so she chose to trust him, a decision made more by her belly than her brain. 

So they carried on and on and on, until Vanessa was quite afraid that she would not be able to make it back up the stairs to her room. But at that moment, Julius finished the last packet of crisps- barbeque flavoured- and tugged out a huge wicker basket of vegetables that was hiding underneath the pile of wrappers. Vanessa thought that surely, he could not continue eating all the way through the parsnips and peppers and peas. What kind of cuisine consumed manic had she encountered? But looking back to where the basket had been, she saw a hole in the wall. A big old hole, and through it a delightful darkness, accompanied by an orchestra of night sounds and cool free-range air. 
 
Vanessa’s chin would have hit the floor, had she not been taught never to open her mouth while chewing. The hole was just about big enough to fit through and the night had never been so warm and inviting as in that moment. She gulped and raised her eyebrows readily. But still Vanessa wondered,
“Why me? Why did you choose… me to come with you?”
Julius looked at her as if the answer had been clear all along,
“You remind me of Vanity.”
And with that, they went out into the world.

Without looking back, they fumbled through the long grass of marshes under moonlight, soaking already damp feet falling into puddles. They carried on running, walking then trailing into the early hours of morning into fields and through valleys. While treading to avoid the cow patches, Vanessa thought that they had surely been going in circles, as there could not be so many fields as they had trod across on the earth. But before she could mention anything to her companion, she caught her foot and fell over a lump in the mud. 

“Ouch!”
Said a voice, but it was not Vanessa’s. The newly freed pair shared an equally alarmed expression and looked to where the sound had emerged. There was a boy laying in a zig-zag on the grass. He yawned and rubbed his eyes then squinted at Vanessa carelessly,
“What’d you do that for?”
“I’m very sorry.”
“I was having the most wonderful dream.”
The boy disgruntled.
“Well, who are you?”
Vanessa asked. 

The Boy whose Dreams are Better than Reality

Ross was an unhappy boy. He possessed an ever-expanding ego that could fill a room to the point where there was no space for anyone else, and a temper so volatile everyone in the vicinity would have to evacuate his general area encase of detonation. The reason for his irritable nature was that ordinary waking life could not even try to compare to the power of his sleeping mind’s imagination. He would spend days long cocooned in a dream so rich and boundless that anyone who dared wake him risked everything in doing so. Some nights he would lounge about smoking shisha with Arabian princes, and travel around toffee kingdoms where rivers ran abundantly of honey, and sometimes he would be a character in a murder mystery as gripping as a television show. There, in his minds eye, colours waved and crashed on so fiercely on his senses enough to intoxicate him close to comatose. When Vanessa and Julius found him, he was having a cup of tea with the queen of mars. And at that moment she was about to answer his question about the nature of the universe that would reveal what astrophysicists have been attempting to figure out for over a millennium. 

“Were you asleep?”
Vanessa asked.
“Well aren’t you a genius. A real Sherlock Groans!”
“I think he’s Holmes.”
“How dare you!”
The boy retorted,
“Nobody would live here. No. I lived in that village yonder, but I left homes to find the Isle of Yess.”
“The isle of Yess?”
Vanessa inquired.
“Yes, the Isle of Yess, just off of the May-bee Coast.”
His face glazed over like a donut,
“Where fantasies are made and the everyday is no-day. We read about it in class. Of course I fell asleep before I could see how the story ends- but the middle was miraculous! My teacher told us it’s the world we always dreamed of but better. Of course that sent me straight into a slumber, but I had the most marvellous dream I was there, on the Isle of Yess. I’d go as far as to say it’s the best dream I’ve ever had.”
The boy sighed,
“Sometimes I wonder why my eyes ever open at all.”
The two escapees didn’t know what to say.
“The Isle of Yess?”
Vanessa puzzled.
Julius stroked his chin,
“I’ve ‘eard of that place. It isn’t real though sonny. The closer you go to that place the more fictional everything gets. Even the May-Bee coast is something close to imaginary. Of course that’s partly down to pollution. The closer to the coast you get, the more the grass and trees start to look like descriptions. The people you're bound to meet are fairly fictitious too. Even the sea down there looks fairly published.”
Julius scraped a bit of mud off his shoe with his hand. Vanessa was shocked, she had not heard Julius speak a word since they fled the Asylum, meanwhile the little boy Ross had drifted back to sleep. Vanessa turned to Julius, the sparks of a rumbling idea emitting from her whole veneer-
“I say we go. Down to Yess, I mean. We’re already on the run, what’s the use of running if there’s no destination?”
Julius shrugged and spat out a piece of grass. Vanessa interpreted this as a seal of approval and with Julius’ help, she dragged the sleepy boy from out of the mud. 

Ross seemed to have a flimsy, although confident, idea of the general direction that would allow the new comrades to unearth the May-Bee coast and from there, weasel their way to the Isle of Yess. However, Ross was always excessively drowsy, when he wasn’t asleep altogether, and had to be dragged along by his arms like a limp scarecrow almost constantly. If he was in a particularly deep slumber, the two would shake him until he pointed in the direction that they ought to head next. All this walking and carrying came of nothing and Vanessa had begun to think that Ross was more delirious than he was compass. But as they wandered through a hay field, a mist encompassed the terrain and the golden grass grew higher and thicker, until soon their sight was simple, pure whiteness accompanied by a concerto of crunches. Immediately Ross’ little head struck up like a match as he sucked in the opaque air. 

“The Mists of Almost,”
The little boy observed,
“We’re nearly there.”
A bubble of giddiness consumed the trio, the promise of a higher freedom was quite delectable. The adrenaline of almost had perked Ross up considerably and he was now able to walk awake without Vanessa or Julius’ assistance, which was a relief to both shoulders.

The mist relaxed, and out of it came a shady lake and shadows that gave few hints. The three, intertwined,
