title: The Blue Office

Out of time tunes repeat and ring
Around my limping ear
Brown envelopes stacked in slightly uneven piles
Slightly uneven people stacked in piles
Blue is shoved thickly on walls
Around the small rooms
Seeping slowly into one another
Like an abundant sky
But a dense one
Dug into concrete 

The sickening tune repeats
Like a bird built in a smoky factory
Artificial light courses through the ceilings veins
And hidden cogs appear in sound
And mimic a crashing river
And people drift like uninhabited bodies
And scratch through their blue filled hiding
Their organs too in a drowsy state
Like spiders trapped in an unexpected glass
As they fill envelopes with names and people
And they too
Blend into blue
